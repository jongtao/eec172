 * @brief  Sets the standard interrupt flags based on the interrupt received from the module 
 * @param[in]  none
 * @param[out]  none
 * @return  none
 * @section description 
 * When the MCU is configured for Interrupt mode. this API should be called in the 
 * Interrupt Service Routine service the interrupt from the Wi-Fi module. The interrupt 
 * signal from the Wi-Fi module is an active-high level-sensitive interrupt. 
 * So, it is recommended that the interrupt be disabled first, then this API be called 
 * and then the interrupt be enabled.In polling mode the application should call this 
 * API explicitly to update the events from the module. This API reads the content 
 * of interrupt status register and updates the events accordingly.
 * 
 * @section prerequisite 
 * MCU interrupt should be enabled, also called from polling mode
